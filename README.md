DESIGN
Outside main class:
1) Create a List Array of type String
2) Assuming the user entry won’t exceed 100 lines before “exe” as input, set
initial index of string to a class name(same as java file name) followed by a
main function , set all other indices upto 99 as “ ” set 100 and 101 to “}” to
end the main method block and class.
3) A separate class to implement compilation of a java file (.java) and creating
a compiled file in the same directory
4) A separate class to run the compiled file and store the output in a file.
In main class:
1) User Interface:
Console-based interface with the ">>>" prompt.
Accepts user input for Java code snippets.
2) Input Processing:
Parse and analyze user input.
Append all the statements onto a file (.java)
3) Interpreter Engine:
Compile the java file before running.
Run the compiled java file and store the output in a file.
4) Output Display:
Show results or errors based on the executed code.
5) Error Handling:
Implement mechanisms to handle syntax errors, runtime exceptions, etc.
